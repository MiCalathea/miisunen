- 👋 Hi, I’m @miisunen, my real name in Johanna
- 👀 I’m interested in many things but my favourites are maps and orienteering.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python. I love problem solving, and what comes about code, yes you really have problems.
- 💞️ I’m looking for a new job. I am currently at permanent job position but I am looking for something new from IT area. I am not a coding expert so maybe something not-so-techy at first.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Not sure if it is a good idea to write contact info here, but if u are reading this, maybe you know some ways to reach me anyway. Hope so!
